### Purpose

This application is designed to support efforts to reform gun control law and policy in the USA, Canada, Mexico, South Africa, UK and Australia. These countries have varying gun control regimes, but still have levels of gun violence. 

This site is designed to provide a co-ordination point for developers and communications professionals who can donate some of their time and expertise to gun control efforts. In particular, developing strategies for influencing the political agenda in these jurisdictions. 

### Features

The site allows users to sign-up and track specific US politicians, and will enable users to follow those politicians' support or oppositioon to gun control measures. The site uses a PostgreSQL database to retain user preferences and the politicians' users are tracking. As more detailed information is added, this will give users visibility into individual politicians' support or opposition to sensible gun law reform. This will encourage accountability amongst politicians and monitoring of how they vote to support reform.

The site will also keep links to resources on gun policy and law reform from relevant jurisdictions. It will ultimately also include a campaign engine to allow individuals to see where gun rallies are being held, and enable them to donate to legitimate gun control groups.

### Technologies

Key technologies used in this project:
* Ruby on Rails
* PostgreSQL & database modelling
* Heroku (for deployment), GitHub
* Devise
* Nokogiri (for scraping politician data)
* HTML5
* CSS3
* SCSS

### Challenges

The primary technical challenge was successfully integrating devise into this RoR project. In addition, tracking user politician selections, and ensuring the database was correctly updating in the Heroku deployment with PostgreSQL. 

### Project status

Much of the campaign engine work is yet to be completed, and I continue to work on improving this platform and adding features.

### Acknowledgements

Thanks to the Sydney GA crew for their help and patience with supporting my efforts to get this app up and running.
