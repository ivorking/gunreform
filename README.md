This application is designed to support efforts to reform gun control laws in the USA, Mexico and South Africa. These jurisdictions have relatively high levels of gun related violence.

Thanks to the Sydney GA crew for their help and patience getting this app up and running.

If you have any feedback, suggestions for improvement, or would like to contribute to this project email ivorking@gmail.com

Thanks,
Ivor.
